# DataAnalysis
Data analysis for open data named as car pricing

In this data analysis, I explored an automobile dataset using Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scipy. I calculated and visualized correlations between selected numerical features like engine size, highway miles per gallon, peak RPM, stroke, and car prices. Additionally, I used boxplots to analyze the relationship between categorical variables (body style, engine location, and drive wheels) and prices. Further, I conducted statistical tests and created a pivot table to understand the average prices based on different combinations of drive wheels and body styles. The analysis provided insights into the relationships between various features and car prices in the dataset.
